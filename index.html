            <h2>Terms &amp; Conditions</h2>
            <p>
              By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically
              apply to you – you should make sure therefore that you read them
              carefully before using the app. You’re not allowed to copy, or
              modify the app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way.
              You’re not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the
              app, and you also shouldn’t try to translate the app into other
              languages, or make derivative versions. The app itself, and all
              the trade marks, copyright, database rights and other intellectual
              property rights related to it, still belong to Minami Munakata.
            </p>
            <p>
              Minami Munakata is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful
              and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right
              to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any
              time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or
              its services without making it very clear to you exactly what
              you’re paying for.
            </p>
            <p>
              The WakeMeApp app stores and processes personal data that you have
              provided to us, in order to provide my Service. It’s your
              responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We
              therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone,
              which is the process of removing software restrictions and
              limitations imposed by the official operating system of your
              device. It could make your phone vulnerable to
              malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s
              security features and it could mean that the WakeMeApp app won’t
              work properly or at all.
            </p>
            <p>
              You should be aware that there are certain things that Minami
              Munakata will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of
              the app will require the app to have an active internet
              connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your
              mobile network provider, but Minami Munakata cannot take
              responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if
              you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your
              data allowance left.
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>
              If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should
              remember that your terms of the agreement with your mobile network
              provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your
              mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the
              connection while accessing the app, or other third party charges.
              In using the app, you’re accepting responsibility for any such
              charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside
              of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning
              off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on
              which you’re using the app, please be aware that we assume that
              you have received permission from the bill payer for using the
              app.
            </p>
            <p>
              Along the same lines, Minami Munakata cannot always take
              responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to make
              sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery
              and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service, Minami Munakata
              cannot accept responsibility.
            </p>
            <p>
              With respect to Minami Munakata’s responsibility for your use of
              the app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to bear in mind
              that although we endeavour to ensure that it is updated and
              correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide
              information to us so that we can make it available to you. Minami
              Munakata accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect,
              you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality
              of the app.
            </p>
            <p>
              At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently
              available on Android – the requirements for system(and for any
              additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app
              to) may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you
              want to keep using the app. Minami Munakata does not promise that
              it will always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or
              works with the Android version that you have installed on your
              device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the
              application when offered to you, We may also wish to stop
              providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without
              giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise,
              upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you
              in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if
              needed) delete it from your device.
