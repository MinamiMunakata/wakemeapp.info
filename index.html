                of an error in the app I collect data and information (through

              <h5><strong>Cookies</strong></h5>

              <p>
                Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly
                used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent to your
                browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on your
                device's internal memory.
              </p>
              <p>
                This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However,
                the app may use third party code and libraries that use
                “cookies” to collect information and improve their services. You
                have the option to either accept or refuse these cookies and
                know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you choose
                to refuse our cookies, you may not be able to use some portions
                of this Service.

                I want to inform users of this Service that these third parties
                have access to your Personal Information. The reason is to

                are obligated not to disclose or use the information for any
                other purpose.

                thus we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of
                protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over

                these external sites are not operated by me. Therefore, I
                strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these
                websites. I have no control over and assume no responsibility
                for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any

              <p>
                These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. I do
                not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from
                children under 13. In the case I discover that a child under 13
                has provided me with personal information, I immediately delete
                this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you
                are aware that your child has provided us with personal
                information, please contact me so that I will be able to do
                necessary actions.
